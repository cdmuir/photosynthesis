\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe}

\item{varnames}{Variable names

For the Ball-Berry model: varnames = list(A_net = "A_net", C_air = "C_air",
g_sw = "g_sw", RH = "RH") where A_net is net CO2 assimilation, C_air is CO2
concentration at the leaf surface in umol mol-1, g_sw is stomatal
conductance to H2O, and RH is relative humidity as a proportion.

For the Leuning model: varnames = list(A_net = "A_net", C_air = "C_air",
g_sw = "g_sw", VPD = "VPD") where A_net is net CO2 assimilation, C_air is
CO2 concentration at the leaf surface in umol mol-1, g_sw is stomatal
conductance to H2O, and VPD is leaf to air vapor pressure deficit in kPa.

For the Medlyn et al. 2011 models: varnames = list(A_net = "A_net",
C_air = "C_air", g_sw = "g_sw", VPD = "VPD") where A_net is net CO2
assimilation, C_air is CO2 concentration at the leaf surface in umol mol-1,
g_sw is stomatal conductance to H2O, and VPD is leaf to air vapor pressure
deficit in kPa.}

\item{model}{Which model(s) to fit? Defaults to all models. Available
options are "BallBerry", "Leuning", "Medlyn_partial", and "Medlyn_full",
from Ball et al. (1987), Leuning (1995), and Medlyn et al. (2011).}

\item{D0}{Vapor pressure sensitivity of stomata (Leuning 1995)}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass on to the nlsLM() function for the Medlyn
models.}

\value{
fit_gs_model fits one or more stomatal conductance models to the
data. The top level of the output list is named after the fitted model,
while the second level contains the Model, Parameters, and Graph, in that
order.
