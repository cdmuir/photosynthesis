## Model C3 Photosynthesis

## Description

**photosynthesis** is an R package with modeling tools for C3 photosynthesis, as well as analytical tools for curve-fitting plant ecophysiology responses. It uses the R package [**units**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=units) to ensure that parameters are properly specified and transformed before calculations. 

## Get **photosynthesis**

From CRAN

```r
install.packages("photosynthesis")
```

or from GitHub

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cdmuir/photosynthesis")
```

And load `photosynthesis`

```r
library("photosynthesis")
```
