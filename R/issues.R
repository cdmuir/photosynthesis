# Issues

#- check in FvCB to make sure leaf_pars are baked
# figure out hyperbolic minimum of 3 values (W_carboc, W_regen, W_tpu)
# more reasonable V_tpu assumption? see Texas Tech dude paper?
# check k_sc -> sr conversion
# what are defaults for g_xc and g_ic?
# how do K_c, K_o and gammaStar covary?
# add cuticular conductance to CO2?
