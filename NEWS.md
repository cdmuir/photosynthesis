# photosynthesis 1.0.0

Description: Simulate C$_3$ photosynthesis using the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, Berry (1980) model as described in Buckley and Diaz-Espejo (2015). It uses units to ensure that parameters are properly specified and transformed before calculations. Temperature response functions get automatically "baked" into all parameters based on leaf temperature following Bernacchi et al. (2002). The package includes boundary layer, cuticular, stomatal, and mesophyll conductances to CO$_2$, which each can vary on the upper and lower portions of the leaf. Use straightforward functions to simulate photosynthesis over environmental gradients such as Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD) and leaf temperature, or over trait gradients such as CO$_2$ conductance or photochemistry. 

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
